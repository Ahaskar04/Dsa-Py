# 🧠 Structured Problem Solving Framework

## ✅ Step 1: Understand the Problem

> The goal is to clarify the problem fully before jumping into solutions.

- Can we **restate the problem** in our own words?
- What are the **inputs** that go into the problem?
- What are the **expected outputs**?
- Can the outputs be **determined from the inputs**? (Do we have enough information?)
- What are the **important pieces of data**? Label them clearly.

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Explore Examples

> Build intuition by working through input-output cases.

- Start with **simple, basic examples**
- Gradually move to **more complex** examples
- Explore **edge cases** (e.g. empty input)
- Explore **invalid inputs** (and define how they should be handled)

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Break It Down

> Don't code yet — plan first.

- Write out the **main steps** in **comments or pseudocode**
- Think in terms of sub-problems or helper functions
- Plan control flow and data transformations

---

## 🔧 Step 4: Solve or Simplify

> Handle complexity smartly.

- Identify the **core difficulty**
- Temporarily **ignore the hardest part**
- Solve a **simplified version** of the problem
- Gradually **incorporate the full complexity** into your solution

---

## 🔁 Step 5: Look Back and Refactor

> Validate and improve.

- Can we **check the result** or verify correctness?
- Can we **derive the result in a different way**?
- Can someone **understand it at a glance**?
- Can we **reuse this method** in another problem?
- Can we **optimize the performance**?
- How have **others solved this problem**?
